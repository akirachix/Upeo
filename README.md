****#Inspiration****
This project was inspired by teenage girls who are unable to access education while on maternity after being sent out of school and are expected to go and repeat the same class where they will have forgotten alot of things learnt previously because they have not been keeping track  on what they had learnt previously.

****#About Project****
This project is an Interactive Offline learning channel that is aimed to provide the students with revision questions while at home throughout the maternity period inorder for them to keep track on different topics in different subjects and not forget whatever was taught previously in school before they dropped out so that when they go back to school they do not start from scratch but assume that they have been learning as well and continue with the rest of the students without being left lagging behind.

We decided to use a USSD code where students will be able to access it offline due to internet issues in certain areas and they will dial and be able to access different questions on different subjects for revision and as well answer them where their answers will be reviewed and their score sent to help to help read more and understand exactly what is needed in a certain topic.
