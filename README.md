****#Inspiration****

This project was inspired by teenage girls who are unable to access education while on maternity after being sent out of school for maternity. Most of these students  are sent out of school where they are forced to stay home for one year until their babies are six months old. This makes them not able to access learning materials while they are away for maternty and most them gets back to school when they have forgotten alot of things learnt previously as  they fail to keep track  on what they had learnt previously.

****#About Project****

This project is an Interactive Offline learning channel that is aimed to provide the students with revision questions while at home throughout the maternity period inorder for them to keep track on different topics in different subjects and not forget whatever was taught previously in school before they dropped out.This helps most of the students in that when they get back to school they do not start from scratch but assume that they have been learning as well and continue with the rest of the students without lagging behind.

We decided to use a USSD code where students will be able to access it offline due to low connectivity of internet in Northern Uganda and lack of access to smartphones by most students. The students  will dial a USSD using feature phones and be able to access different questions on different subjects for revision and as well answer them where their answers will be reviewed and their score sent to help read more and understand exactly what is needed in a certain topic.
